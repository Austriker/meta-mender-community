I. Adding the meta-mender-demo-app-updates layer to your build
=================================================

Run 'bitbake-layers add-layer meta-mender-demo-app-updates'

II. Purpose
===========

The layer contains an example setup for a Yocto build which is enabled
to receive docker-compose orchestrated application updates, as described
in the [Mender documentation](https://docs.mender.io/artifact-creation/create-an-artifact/docker-compose).

The example image "mender-app-update-image" installs the required Update Module
onto a `core-image-full-cmdline` image.

III. Included functionality
===========================

The docker-compose based Update Module requires
- docker & docker-compose to be installed
- the respective kernel features to be enabled
- the `iptables` NAT/masquerading functionality to be built in.

The former two are provided by the `meta-virtualization`.

For the Raspberry Pi, an example kernel configuration fragment is supplied that
configures `iptables` as required. To use the layer on different board, porting
the `netfilter.cfg` fragment is probably required.
